## ℹ️ About

The WMA format has long been common in Windows environments but lacks full support in Apple’s ecosystem. iTunes, Music app, and QuickTime cannot play WMA files natively. Users often face frustration when trying to import WMA into their iPhones, iPads, or Mac apps.  

**EasyWMA** solves this by acting as a **fast, lightweight, and user-friendly converter**. It’s optimized for macOS performance, avoiding the bloat of larger audio suites while focusing on one task: **making WMA files usable everywhere**.  

Beyond WMA, EasyWMA also handles formats like ASF, OGG, and FLAC, making it more versatile than its name suggests. The tool preserves metadata when possible, supports large files, and ensures audio quality remains intact after conversion.  

Its minimal design and straightforward controls make it a perfect fit for both casual listeners and power users with large archives of incompatible audio.
